# Loan-Prediction
 
Hey and welcome to my first GitHub repo and my first machine learning project. I had a lot of fun making it and it is, hopefully, just the start of my ML career. 
The project is a simple web application that compares the performance between different machine learning algorithms on the SBA loan repayment dataset. Please take 
a look and let me know what you think! 

Here's the link to the app.
